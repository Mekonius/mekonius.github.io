# :musical_note: My Spotify Library :notes:

Welcome to My Spotify Library! This is a fun project that I created to explore the Spotify API and build a simple web app that lets me view my Spotify library.

## :rocket: Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000` where you can view the app.

## :tada: Features

My Spotify Library has a number of fun features that you can use to explore your Spotify library:

- **View your saved albums:** See all of the albums you've saved to your Spotify library.
- **Filter and search:** Use the search bar to filter and search through your library.
- **Play tracks and albums:** Click on a track or album to play it directly in Spotify.
- **Responsive design:** The app is designed to look great on desktop and mobile devices.

## :robot: Tech Stack

My Spotify Library is built with the following technologies:

- **JavaScript:** The app is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.
- **Spotify API:** The app uses the Spotify API to access your library and play music.
- **Node.js:** The app is built on a Node.js backend.
- **Express:** The app uses the Express framework to handle HTTP requests.
- **Webpack:** The app is bundled with Webpack.
